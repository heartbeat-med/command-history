# command-history package

History of your latest commands. Hassle-free recall commands from the past.

To view your latest commands hit `ctrl-shift-cmd-P`.
To view your favorite commands from the current session hit `ctrl-shift-cmd-O`.

command-history will ignore commands from the **blacklist**. You can add a complete package with the wildcard symbol `*`. For example: `core:*` will add all commands from the core package to the blacklist.
Just add a command to the blacklist by hitting `cmd-x` while the command is selected in the history.
