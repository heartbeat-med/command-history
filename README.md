# command-history package

History of your latest commands. Easily recall commands from the past.

command-history will ignore commands from the *blacklist*. You can add a complete package with the wildcard symbol `*`. For example: `core:*` will add all commands from the core package to the blacklist.
Easily add a command to the blacklist by hitting `cmd-x` while the command is selected in the history.
